## Overview of Project
Data is considered "Big Data" when it exceeds the capacity of operational databases. *Apache Hadoop* (Hadoop) is one of the most popular open source frameworks, with numerous technologies for big data. Cloud services let us store large amounts of data at remote locations rather than locally on top of many other services. Partnering with an account manager at BigMarket, we used the most popular cloud services available: Amazon Web Services (AWS). For this SellBy project, we analyzed Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. We had access to approximately 50 datasets, but picked reviews specifically for the product-- watches. We used *PySpark* to perform the *ETL* process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Afterwards, we used *PySpark* to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset. Last, we wrote an analysis to submit to the SellBy stakeholders.
